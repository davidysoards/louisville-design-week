## Gatsby

Gatsby is an Static-Site-Generator for **React** and uses **GraphQL** to query data. It gives developers all the benefits of a dynamic web app and serves it up as super fast HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

## 👩‍🎤 Emotion CSS-in-JS Library

I used @emotion/styled for most of the styling. https://emotion.sh/

## 💫 Netlify

This site is deployed with Netlify.
