Design is, at it’s best, the convergence of a universal source of
creativity. It doesn’t depend on any of the barriers or segregations
that humans both consciously and subconsciously impose upon
themselves. It requires that we be open and accepting. The convergence
is something not only aesthetically beautiful, but also accessible to
the greatest extent possible by everyone regardless of age, race,
gender, ability or status.

This is design that belongs to everyone. Design that unites us. It is
ALWAYS OPEN.
