Design is, at its best, the convergence of a universal source of creativity. It doesnâ€™t depend on any of the barriers or segregations that humans both consciously and subconsciously impose upon themselves. It requires that we be open and accepting. The convergence is something not only aesthetically beautiful, but also accessible to the greatest extent possible by everyone regardless of age, race, gender, ability or status.

This is design that belongs to everyone. Design that unites us. It is ALWAYS OPEN.
