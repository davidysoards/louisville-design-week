She helps people create things that are stunning, but also, just a little peculiar. Pretty Strange is based in the philosophy of creating art that is within reach, and uniting imagination with the everyday.</p><p>&ldquo;Every once in a while, you stumble across something so offbeat, it’s beautiful. I was once told &lsquo;pretty&rsquo; and &lsquo;strange&rsquo; was the best way to describe me, and it’s also the best summation of the things I create. Whimsical, odd, and a little perplexing, but also detailed, refined and elegant.&rdquo;</p>'
