    description: Dana is a New York City-based lettering artist and designer who enjoys living a quiet life and working with her hands. In 2009, an impromptu chalk installation for a Brooklyn housewarming party landed Dana her first commission for Google and set the popular chalk-lettering trend—and her career—in motion.

    title: 'Friday the 13th Cemetery Typography Tour'
    description: At one time Louisville was an epicenter of monument design, and Cave Hill Cemetery is filled with many beautiful examples of why. Join the Cave Hill staff on a design-centric walking tour of Louisville's Historic Cave Hill Cemetery. We will get a brief history of stone carving processes (new and old) and how that influences monument design over the years. This is your chance to find the hidden typographic gems of Cave Hill and meet the people who design, restore and preserve the monuments of this Louisville treasure. Stick around afterwards to make some of your own grave rubbings!

    title: 'Gail Anderson: Think Design - Keynote Address'
    description: So much of our time is spent looking down, typically at some kind of screen. But there are places to find inspiration beyond Instagram or a Pinterest board. Hear tales from a “veteran” designer (as anyone of a certain age who's still working is called). Discover ways to keep your work fresh. Learn how to remain challenged. Or just show up because it's the final presentation of an amazing week—and probably the best way to jumpstart an inspired weekend. But prepare to exchange ideas with someone who's still thinking about design pretty much all the time, even 35 year in. It'll be fun.
